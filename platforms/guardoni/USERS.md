## User survey

So, we are thinking about guardoni as a desktop app to simplify the experience of guardoni from command line (guardoni-cli).

The idea so far is to create a tool that allows users to participate to the experiments that will be defined by us and the user will be able to replicate them with different profiles and more than one time.

This is the general idea, but we are in a position where we can still adjust the concept a little, and since you could be a perfect example of user case, I'm asking you some questions:

1. As a researcher how do you deal with algo recommendation analysis?
2. Can you describe me your experience with guardoni-cli?
3. What was for you the most umcomfortable or frustrating trait while dealing with guardoni-cli?
4. Have you ever tried other tools from tracking.exposed?
5. What kind of experiments are you interested in?
6. What would you like to do with the new guardoni? Could you describe the ideal software?
7. What do you think will make guardoni a good tool for you? What features do you need?
8. Are you familiar with data analysis? Is a file.csv ok for you?
9. Would you like to analyse the data you collected or also the ones of other people?
10. Do you think you will ask other people to use the tool?
11. What do you think about our idea? Can you tell me if you see some criticality in this already?
