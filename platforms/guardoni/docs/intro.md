# Guardoni documentation

Guardoni is a free software **automated web scraper**, used to collect data about platforms as Youtube and Tik Tok. It is a [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)-based tool integrating Tracking Exposed extensions on its browser. Data is gathered and copied from platforms into our database for later retrieval or analysis.

## üî¨ How we collect data

_Guardoni_ is not the direct responsible of collecting data while browsing, as it is, in simple words, just a wrapper around puppeteer with some automation features. The data scraping and collection is made by our browser extensions, loaded by _Guardoni_ at bootstrap.

## üß™ Experiments

Experiments are instructions prepared to perform a series of actions. They are csv files with a list of URLs and and watching time. They belong to an exploratory phase, allowing us to work on a common basis and compare differences.

## üèπ Design principles

- **User friendly**. Guardoni should be easy to learn and use, users shall not feel overwhelmed. It should look intuitive and easy to build on top of, using approaches they are familiar with.

- **Optimal Resource Consumption**. A wise, cost-efficient approach to system resources. Efficiency is one of the critical factors identifying high-quality softwares.

- **Interoperability**. Common data formats and communication protocols to work with other products or systems.
