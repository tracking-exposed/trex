Guardoni is an [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)-based open source tool that lets you collect data while browsing by using our extensions.

## How we collect data

_Guardoni_ is not the direct responsible of collecting data while browsing, as it is, in simple words, just a wrapper around puppeteer with some automation features. The data scraping and collection is made by our browser extensions, loaded by _Guardoni_ at bootstrap.
