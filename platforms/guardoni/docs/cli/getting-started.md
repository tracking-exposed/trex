## Install

Download the proper executable from the [latest release](https://github.com/tracking-exposed/yttrex/releases/latest) and save it as `guardoni-cli`.

Then check the executable is properly working by running the command that opens the tool for free browsing:

```sh
./guardoni-cli yt-navigate
```

If the browser appears on the Youtube's home the installation has been successful.
