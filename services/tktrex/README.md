## Browser extension reviewer? please do this after cloning the repository:

    cd tktrex/extension
    npm install
    npm run build:dist

This produces the **distributed** release, in the directory `dist` you should find `extension.zip` which is thw same file uploaded to Mozilla and Chrome add-ons stores.

## Anybody else (except developers)?

Please refer to [tiktok.tracking.exposed](https://tiktok.tracking.exposed), with this tools we did a bunch of publications and analysis, you can repeat them or imagine your own!
