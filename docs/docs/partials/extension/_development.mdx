## Development



### Prerequisites
* <a href="backend">@{props.platformPrefix}trex/backend</a> up and running

### Run "watch" mode

To start developing the extension you need to compile the source code with `webpack` by running the following command:

<CodeBlock className="language-bash">
  yarn {props.platformPrefix}:ext watch
</CodeBlock>

### Load the extension

In your browser's development panel or in your extension manager, load the extension from the <i>{props.platformPrefix}</i> output folder. To do that, you will need to navigate to `platforms/yttrex/extension/build` and load the extension from that folder.
